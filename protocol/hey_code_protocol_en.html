    <h2>1. Information Collection and Use</h2>
    <p><strong>1.1 Camera Permissions:</strong> Our App may require access to your device's camera so that you can use specific features of the App, such as taking photos or scanning QR codes. Camera permissions will only be requested when you explicitly agree to and use these features.</p>
    <p><strong>1.2 Camera Images:</strong> When you use the camera function of our App, the App may capture and save images from your camera. These images may be used for specific App features but will not be used for any other purpose unless you explicitly consent.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Protection and Storage</h2>
    <p><strong>2.1</strong> We will take reasonable security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of internet transmissions, so you use our App at your own risk.</p>

        <li>When required or permitted by law.</li>
        <li>To protect our rights, property, or safety, as well as the rights, property, or safety of other users.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p><strong>4.1</strong> You have the right to access and modify your personal information and to withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
    <p><strong>4.2</strong> You may disable camera permissions or delete the App, but this may affect the functionality of the App.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
